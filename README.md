# CofenseDemoMail
This project contains two scripts built to send messages to the Demo.CofenseUAT.com (formerly Cofense Demo Inc.) Product Demo environment. Both will send 27 emails with randomized senders and subjects to the recipients contained in the recipients.txt file in the recipient folder. The 'massemails-attach.ps1' version will send a random attachment from a list of 50 contained in the attachment folder. The massemails-urls.ps1 will send a group of 3 random urls from the list contained within the script. 

Both scripts are written in powershell. Mac users using these scripts will need to follow the instructions provided by Microsoft for Powershell on Mac OS.
